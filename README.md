# Roguelike-Game
This is the game made in python as part of Design Patterns course in MIPT in 2018 by Efimochkin Sergey

Move by using arrow keys; You have to gain enough gold to travel to the next planet. The goal of the game is to beat all planets. 

TODO: There's still no saving, loading the game, etc., no variety of items to use and no shops to buy this stuff in. All will put in the game later.
