# Roguelike-Game
This is the game made in python as part of Design Patterns course in MIPT in 2018 by Efimochkin Sergey
The game uses tdl and tcod libraries for gui.

Move by using arrow keys; You have to gain enough gold to travel to the next planet. The goal of the game is to beat all planets. 

TODO: There's still no saving, loading the game, etc., no variety of items to use and no shops to buy this stuff in. All will be put in the game later.
